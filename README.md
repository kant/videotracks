# Video Tracks - Blender Add-on
Video Tracks is a Blender add-on that provides track headers to the channels of the VSE.

**Disclaimer**
>**This tool is currently supported.**
>
>It was initialy developed for an animated TV series production in 2020 on Blender 2.83. It has the features that were needed at the time but it
may not be considered as feature complete for a more generic purpose. In spite of all our efforts to make it reliable some troubles may occur in use cases we have not faced.

Note that development is on Windows 10. Please report issues and submit PRs for other OSs.

**Disclaimer**: This project is in alpha state and actively developed. Do not use it to edit your production assets without a backup or you might break them.


## Purpose

Video Tracks improves the manipulation of the strip channels in the Video Sequence Editor.
It provides a more conventional UI for these channels, making them look and - as much as possible - feel
like video and audio tracks existing in classic editing software. Each channel then gets a "header", an area where it receives
a name and where its content can be globaly controlled.
This is very convenient for previz and 3D layout.
