# Video Tracks

**Disclaimer**: This project is in alpha state and actively developed. Do not use it to edit your production assets without a backup or you might break them.

Note that development is on Windows 10. Please report issues and submit PRs for other OSs.

## Purpose

Video Tracks improves the manipulation of the strip channels in the Video Sequence Editor.
It provides a more conventional UI for these channels, making them look and - as much as possible - feel
like video and audio tracks existing in classic editing software. Each channel then gets a "header", an area where it receives
a name and where its content can be globaly controlled.
This is very convenient for previz and 3D layout.
